This helps us start to form teams so we're not starting the tournament too late.\nThis is a monthly Killer Queen Tournament that takes place every fourth Thursday.\nJust a reminder we are 21 & up after 9 PM, but if your team is still playing, younger teammates are allowed to stay.\nHave any questions? Message Free Play Denton or Chris Delp.\nBonus ~ it's 40% off all drafts.\nCan't wait to tap with everyone!",
